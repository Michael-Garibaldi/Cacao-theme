**Cacao Theme for Emacs**

This is a theme I created with assistance from [RickMMA](https://github.com/RickMMA) It came about while I was working at my last tech support job.
I had a client send me an image of their television.

As was my normal custom, I loaded it up in MS-Paint and inverted the colors **(CTRL-Shift-I)**  to check for lines on the screen
and I saw this:

I saw that and thought the color scheme would look **great** as an emacs theme.

**W.I.P**

This is very much a work in progress at this time.  Currently it looks like:

**To install**

Download the .el file and install it in your theme directory. 

**WINDOWS INSTALLATION**

For  Windows you can search an for an existing theme by using explorer and search for
**themename-theme** and which ever directory shows up (for windows 11, the directory I show is **C:\Program Files\Emacs\emacs-29.1\share\emacs\29.1\etc\themes**.

Copy this theme into that directory and it should show up immediataely when
you access the "*Custom-Themes*" buffer.  Just click and run after that, it's one
file.


**LINUX**

Use the **whereis** or **locate** command to find where your themes are stored by 
entering **whereis** or **locate** *themename-theme* (use one of your existing themes
of course).  

Copy this file to that directory, Emacs should show it immediately after you access
the "*Custom-Themes*" buffer.  Just click on it and run it after that. It's one file only.



This theme was written in Emacs 29.1 , therefore it will definitely work in 29.1. I'm unsure if it will work in earlier versions, but it's pretty simplistic.

Enjoy!
