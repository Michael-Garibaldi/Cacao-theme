**Cacao Theme for Emacs**

This is a theme I created with assistance from [RickMMA](https://github.com/RickMMA) It came about while I was working at my last tech support job.
I had a client send me an image of their television.

As was my normal custom, I loaded it up in MS-Paint and inverted the colors **(CTRL-Shift-I)**  to check for lines on the screen
and I saw this:

I saw that and thought the color scheme would look **great** as an emacs theme.

**W.I.P**

This is very much a work in progress at this time.  Currently it looks like:

**To install**

Download the .el file and install it in your theme directory.  You **<ins>may</ins>** have to add it into your theme directory.
This theme was written in Emacs 29.1 , therefore it will definitely work in 29.1. I'm unsure if it will work in earlier versions, but it's pretty simplistic.

Enjoy!
